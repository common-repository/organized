Organized allows you to add notes, todo lists, files & more within your admin area.

== Description ==

Organized is a free plugin for taking notes, keeping to-do lists and saving images and files that will help keep you organized.

Use Organized to quickly write down ideas, create shopping lists, daily to-do lists, upcoming blog post ideas, save images from around the web, reminder notes or just about anything else you can think of. 

The plugin is built around the idea of adding 'Things' to the Organized 'Dashboard'. 
A Thing can be anything you like - it can be an image or a file, a title, a to-do list, notes, dates or any combination of these.

The Dashboard can be set as a 1, 2, 3 or 4 column layout and it uses a drag and drop interface to re-arrange Things on the Dashboard. Everything is saved using AJAX so there are no page refreshes and your Dashboard will be saved for the next time you visit the page.

The Organized Dashboard is viewed in your WordPress admin area - there is no front end display for the Organized plugin.

Each WordPress user gets their own Dashboard, with the Dashboard data being saved into the usermeta table of each user.

= Notes =

Easily jot down notes by using the notes field. It is so easy to quickly jot down ideas or reminders.

= Todo List =

Create endless and unlimited todo lists and tick off what is completed or delete what you no longer need. 

= Add Files =

Each Thing can have an image or a file attached to it.

= Dates =

Give yourself timelines for your Things by adding a Start Date and an End Date.

* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Organized, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Organized” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
